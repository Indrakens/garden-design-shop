## Major Changes
For the begining I was using differnt color sheem for website. There was included different style images. I changed the color scheem and images becouse it looked plain. I added slideshow images to home page and about page. The code for slideshoe I took and modify from [w3school]( https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_js_slideshow_auto ) . 

## Bugs
