# MAJOR CHANGES
In the beginning, I used different color schemes for the website. There were included different style images. I changed the color scheme and images because they looked plain. I added slideshow images to the home page and about page.

# BUGS
I had an issue with the circle image on the home page, when I was resizing the screen the circle image appeared just half. The issues I had was with no closing divs or adding too many, which caused the issue with the circle image.
